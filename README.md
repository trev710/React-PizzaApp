Pizza Parlor App:

A pizza app, in which the user can select a list of ingredients to go on their pizza.  This will be a step by step format, in which the user selects a type of crust, next a sauce choice, and then cheese, followed by, finally, a selection of toppings. Each ingredient will have a base price, and as a user, you will be able to see a list of all the ingredients through a nav bar, so that there is no confusion on what will be available. In the instance that a user adds an ingredient and then decides they no longer want it, there will be an option to remove that ingredient, or simply start the dish over. The navbar will also take the user to a checkout menu to show the total cost of the created pizza.
The core features:
 
user should be able to add and remove toppings to their pizza
user should be able to check out their pizza with a total cost added to it.
user should be able to route to a page showing all the ingredients to them with cost
user should be able to navigate between the checkout and pizza maker
user should be able to see their pizza toppings as an image 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
